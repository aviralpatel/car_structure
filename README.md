# Car shop program in C

This C program is a basic implementation of a car shop inventory management system. The program uses a structure named carshop to store information about the cars in the inventory.


The program starts by declaring an array of carshop structures named v. The size of the array is not defined, so it is recommended to use a constant value instead of the variable i.

Next, a for loop is used to iterate over the array and prompt the user to input information about each car in the inventory. The user is asked to input the name of the car, the price, the manufacturing year, and the category model.

After each input, the program prints out the information to the console using printf(). The user input is stored in the corresponding member of the carshop structure using scanf().

Note that the program uses the & operator to pass the address of the name and ch members of the carshop structure to scanf(). This is because name and ch are character arrays, which are represented as pointers in C.

Once all the information is inputted and printed to the console, the program ends by returning 0.

Overall, this program provides a basic framework for a car shop inventory management system. However, it is important to note that this program is missing several key features, such as the ability to search or modify the inventory, and it does not implement error handling for invalid input.
